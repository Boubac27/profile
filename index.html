            <p>In Pennsylvania, six-year-old girls Anna and Joy have disappeared. Detective Loki favors the continuation of the abduction of Keller, Anna's father. The suspect number one is quickly arrested but is released a few days later, for lack of evidence, with the fury of Keller. Blinded by his pain, the devastated father then launches into a race against the clock to find the missing children.</p>

            <p>Zodiac, the elusive serial killer who raged in the late 1960s and spread terror in the San Francisco area, was the Jack the Ripper of America. Produced in encrypted messages, he sowed clues like so many white pebbles, and took pleasure in taunting the press and the police. Robert Graysmith, a young and shy cartoonist, launched his body and soul into what would become the investigation of his life.</p>
